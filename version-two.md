## Focus on privacy and sharing data with known people

I've discovered that wnfs already has a way to do read permissions on a per-user basis. That's kind of interesting because it's all based on decryption capabilities instead of access control.

And wnfs gives us a common backend for users, which makes identity easier.

> to share private files with a group of people, you would need to write down the list of people in the group. Then call `fs.sharePrivate` and pass it the list of other users.

So wnfs I think has everything needed for this usecase. At this point it's more a matter of finding time to try this & build some UI for it.
